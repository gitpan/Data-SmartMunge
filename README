NAME
    Data::SmartMunge - Munge scalars, hashes and arrays in flexible ways

VERSION
    version 1.101611

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::SmartMunge ':all';

        my $s = smart_munge('foo bar baz', sub { uc $_[0] });

        my $a_ref = smart_munge([ 1 .. 4 ], sub { [ reverse @{ $_[0] } ] });
        my @a = smart_munge([ 1 .. 4 ], sub { [ reverse @{ $_[0] } ] });

        my %h = smart_munge(
            { a => 'foo', b => 'bar' },
            sub {
                +{ map { $_ => uc $_[0]->{$_} } keys %{ $_[0] } };
            },
        );

        my $h_ref = smart_munge(
            { a => 'foo', b => 'bar' },
            { a => undef, c => 'baz' },
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a generic way to munge scalars, hashes and arrays.

FUNCTIONS
  smart_munge
    Takes as the first argument - the *data* - either a scalar, an array
    reference or a hash reference. Takes as the second argument - the
    *munger* - either a hash or a code reference. It tries to apply the
    munger to the data. For example, if the munger is a code reference, that
    code will be run with the data as an argument. If both data and munger
    are hash references, the munger hash will be overlaid onto the data hash
    and the result will be returned.

    If called in scalar context, any resulting array or hash will be
    returned as a reference. In list context, the array or hash will be
    returned as is.

    If the munger is not defined, the data will be returned unchanged, again
    respecting context.
